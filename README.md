# sites-box

An extension of the [Scotch Box](https://box.scotch.io/) Vagrant lamp stack configured for hosting multiple sites in one box.

Setup requires:

* OS-X
* VirtualBox ([binaries available here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
* Vagrant ([binaries available here](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html))
* XCode (and it's developer tools)
* Homebrew

## Setup

Most of the setup is to get dnsmasq setup on your host machine. It's not strictly necessary, but it'll allow you to use wildcard domains on your sites, which is nice for WordPress multisite and similar projects.

### Setup dnsmasq

* Install dnsmasq via Homebrew: `brew install dnsmasq`
* Run the following commands to setup dnsmasq:

  ```
  cp /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf.example /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
  sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
  sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
  ```

* Decide on the hostname and IP you want to use for the VM. For this example, we'll use `dev1` for the hostname and `192.168.33.10` (that's the Scotch Box default) for the IP. Replace those two strings below as needed (or use them if you'd like).
* Then, add the following line to the top of `/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf`:

  ```
  address=/dev1/192.168.33.10
  ```

* Setup the resolver and load up dnsmasq with the following commands:

  ```
  sudo mkdir -v /etc/resolver
  sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 192.168.33.10" > /etc/resolver/dev1'
  sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist

  # If problems arise or you change something, use the following commands
  # to restart dnsmasq:
  sudo launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
  sudo launchctl start homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
 ```

### Setup the virtual machine

* Use a terminal to `cd` into the root of this project.
* Install the hostmanager Vagrant plugin with `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`
* Make a copy of `config.example.yaml` and rename it `config.yaml`
* Customize `config.yaml` as needed (it's well-commented).
* Start your virtual machine with `vagrant up`

After that, you can visit your (empty) sites in a browser. If you defined a site called `site1` and assigned the hostname `dev1` to your machine, you'll should see it at `http://site1.dev1`. The sites themselves will have directories generated into the `/sites` directory of this project.

## Adding Sites
When you are ready to add sites, add the name for each site you'd like to spin up in `config.yaml` and run `vagrant reload --provision`

## Stumbling Blocks
If you have trouble running `vagrant up` it could be a problem with Virtual Box. See: http://davidwalsh.name/fixing-vagrant-errors. If that doesn't work, try reinstalling Virtual Box. Lastly, restarting the computer has worked for me.
